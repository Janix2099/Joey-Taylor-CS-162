A list of 5 topics I find interesting in relation to computers
1. the basis for how a computer functions is interesting
2. the evolution of computers and their code throughout the years
3. how code manifests into something useable
4. how to create useable code
5. how to learn more about coding

A list of 5 topics that I find will be challenging in relation to computers
1. I imagine learning the physical knitty gritty of things will be difficult
2. I found testing code to be something I didn't understand too much. So being able to stress test in the proper format would be useful.
3. Concise code vs practical code
4. When to incorporate classes in favor of other options
5. Loops can often be confusing
