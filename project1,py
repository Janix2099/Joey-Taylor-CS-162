Overview: 
Creating a class with various methods and variables that uses basic user input to display basic information


    Show me that you can design a Python class for a complex object (car, house, computer, being, container structure) by making me a drawing, list,
    or other document showing or describing your design for your object that shows:

        a few components (for a car it would be something like an interior, a transmission, a chassis, and a motor)

        a few attributes for each component (variables),

        a few behaviors for each component (methods),

        and the relationship between the components, attributes, and behaviors (perhaps with lines showing how a value would get used or calculated)

    a simple program with a menu (user input and output, text in a console is perfectly acceptable) to interact with one of the components that you came up with that:

        Instantiates an object from a class that you write that has attributes and behaviors reflecting your design,

        gets basic input from a user that fills in the attributes of your object,

        displays basic info about your object and its behaviors,

        A menu item that allows the user to quit the program; saying goodbye when selected,

        Note: Be sure to use a loop to get back to the menu after finishing an item (other than quitting) to ask the user what to do next."""


class Submarine:
    """Represents a Submarine
    
    Parts of submarine: oxygen tank, hull depth, fuel, type
    Actions of submarine: Emerge, submerged, motion, weapons(?), sonar 
    Attribute of components: Type = Civilian, military | Fuel = percent full / volume | Oxygen = percent full / volume | hull = dive depth
    
    Example of relationship:
submerge: lose fuel, lose oxygen, lower depth, weapons locked
emerge: lose fuel, gain oxygen, raise depth, weapons unlocked
move: lose fuel. if submerged, lose oxygen. if emerged, gain oxygen
weapon: "weapon fired!", weapons locked, dependent on type of submarine.
sonar: "ping!"
